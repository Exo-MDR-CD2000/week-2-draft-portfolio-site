## INSTRUCTIONS

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport


## TODO

Sections that need to be in the portfolio page:
1) My name (with photo)
2) About Me
3) My work (portfolio section)
4) Contact Info

### My notes

There should be a navgation at the top of the page with links that jump to that section of the site. The UI must scroll to that section of the page instead of an instant jump

The first picture of my first project should be larger than the rest? Is that right? I think so. This is only for the first project result. The others can be standard size like in the demo on the bootcamp page.

When the user clicks on a certain project they are then sent the deployed version of that project. As of 6-20-2023, the only deployed project that I have is week one's challenge for refractored code. Link that one and I suppose put placeholder project cards on the bottom of the first one.

Resizing the site should be responsive to certain screen sizes and devices. Definately use CSS, flexbox, @media, etc. for this part. 


<!-- No javascript needed for this project just yet. Simplisticy is key here. -->

<!-- I will have to put on hold my idea for a portfolio site that has the nav bar on the left and the right side of the page dynamically changing when the user clicks on the nav links. -->
